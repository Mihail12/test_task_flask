TEST TASK FLASK
--

Hello, Thank you that you gave me the opportunity to do this task  

here my solution  

to start app you just need docker-compose  

`docker-compose up -d`

and after it built you could visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/ to see full api documentation

to start test just do after it upped

`docker-compose exec web pytest`
